        Hello, my name is Huston “Fenix” Sampson. I’m a new addition to the Clermont, FL area as well as the Web Development field.  I previously lived in Birmingham, AL where I worked at a car dealership.  Over my employed adulthood I have had jobs that I’ve liked and enjoyed, but working at the car dealership however, introduced me to a job that I truly love.  They had been in business for over 30 years and had decided to expand their web and social media presence.  I had little to no prior experience, but I learned as much as I could.  I found that maintaining their website was one of the things I enjoyed doing most in my day-to-day job.

        The Covid pandemic changed the industry in such a way that they had to restructure, leading to my position being eliminated.  Around this same time, I was presented with an opportunity to start fresh in a new city also.  My partner and I have been visiting the Orlando area for many years now so after lots of discussion we decided to move to Clermont.  After having had a job that I enjoyed so much I was having difficulties imagining myself doing anything different.  I am currently enrolled as a student with the University of Central Florida in their Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  This bootcamp is teaching me so many valuable tools that I am sure to find useful in the future.

        I have a very active imagination that fuels my love for designing and building.  The act of creation is one of my most enjoyed hobbies.  I find great fulfillment in taking a crayon drawing on a napkin and, through a lot of patience and hard work, turning it into a fully formed and functioning product. Even from my earliest years I enjoyed putting individual pieces together to make something new. I’ve found that Web Development is an extension of that love that is so ingrained in my heart.  The only difference between Web Development and building something in the real world is that working in a digital environment has only served to provide me more freedom to truly let my imagination run wild.  I am a firm believer that the imagination is mankind’s greatest tool.  The only real limits are the limits of the imagination.

        When I’m not coding, designing, building or developing you can usually find me playing with my dogs.  My partner and I have four wonderful little balls of fur that keeps us going non-stop.  We go swimming, hiking, bike riding and exploring.  Sometimes the dogs must stay at home for us to go to the Disney parks but for the most part they never leave our sides.  If there is a more fulfilling experience than being on the other end of a dog’s leash, I haven’t yet found it.         </p>
